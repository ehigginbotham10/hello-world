# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I have no idea what I am doing or what I am supposed to write about myself or if I am doing any of this right. As an autistic adult it can be really challenging learning new things in a setting such as this with feeling as if the requests are not as direct as I may feel I need.
